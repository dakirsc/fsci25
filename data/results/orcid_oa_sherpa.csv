The primary purpose is to assess the thermo-hydrodynamic performance of both single and hybrid nanofluids in terms of varying Reynolds numbers and nanoparticle volume concentrations in a double-dimpled pipe. In the double-dimpled corrugated design, the smooth flow is interrupted, allowing small whirlpool zones to form and generating turbulence, which boosts heat exchanger efficiency and prevents particles from dropping out of suspension. The unique design of corrugation enhances heat transfer, allowing for a smaller heat exchanger. Corrugated heat exchangers can be half the size of smooth ones, depending on the application where compact size is required in operation of industries. Assuming a constant and uniform heat flux of 10,000 W/m2, the numerical simulations are conducted at Reynolds numbers ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. The research utilizes computational methods to assess the thermo-hydrodynamic performance of nanofluids (CuO/water, Al2O3/water, TiO2/water) and hybrid nanofluids (Al2O3CuO/water, Al2O3-TiO2/water), along with the effects of double-dimpled surfaces in the pipe with volume concentrations varying from 1% to 3%. The computational fluid dynamics solver is applied to analyze the effective properties of nanofluids based on models. There is a discussion on the results of heat transfer coefficient, temperature distributions, Nusselt number, pressure drop, and friction factors under various working conditions. Different nanoparticle compositions were shown to have a 20–25% higher heat transfer coefficient for the double-dimpled pipe in contrast to the smooth one. A higher Nusselt number is obtained owing to the complexity of the corrugations, that improves heat transfer and pressure drop with high volume fractions. As the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) for corrugated geometries is greater than unity, they can surpass smooth pipes. The 3% Al2O3CuO/water hybrid nanofluid was determined to be the top - performing nanofluid in the double-dimpled pipe flow, with a maximum thermal performance gain of 20.62%.",2023-01-11,6.844,41,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4315618868,NA,TRUE,TRUE,gold,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijft.2023.100283,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S4210194017,2666-2027,https://openalex.org/P4310320990,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijft.2023.100283,NA,publishedVersion,NA,56,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,100283,100283,17,NA,cc-by-nc-nd,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Trend analysis for N rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg N ha−1) and orthogonal contrasts for different application times (pre-plant, top-dressed in February and March) were performed. With increasing fertilizer N, wheat grain yield and protein content increased from 2110 kg ha−1 to 6783 kg ha−1 and from 8.96 to 17.19%, respectively. For grain yield, protein, and N use efficiency, split applications of N fertilizer were much more efficient than applying all N pre-plant.

Our objectives were to investigate crop rotation effects on shoot dry weight and root characteristics of cereal and grain legume crops at anthesis, as well as on grain yield. Rotations were corn ( Zea mays L.)–soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (CS), corn–soybean–spring wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)–field pea ( Pisum sativum L.) (CSSwP), corn–soybean–spring wheat–sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.) (CSSwSf), corn–field pea–winter wheat–soybean (CPWwS), and corn–oat ( Avena sativa L.)–winter wheat‐soybean (COWwS). Crop biomass and root samples were collected at crop anthesis for each crop within the crop rotation. Two soil cores were taken within each of the crops grown in rotation, and the two soil cores were cut into segments of 0–15, 15–30, 30–45, 45–60, 60–90, and 90–120 cm and combined for measuring root length density. Rotations were established in 2000 with plants measured in 2015 and 2016. Rotations had no significant effects on shoot dry weight at anthesis. Small grains had greater root length density than grain legumes between 0‐ and 60‐cm soil depths. Rotation treatments had significant effects only on soybean root length density at 0‐ to 90‐cm soil depths. Soybean following winter wheat (CPWwS and COWwS) had significantly less root length density than soybean following corn. Soybean grain yield was significantly greater following winter wheat (CPWwS and COWwS) than in other rotations. Thus, smaller root systems at anthesis in soybean following winter wheat were associated with higher grain yield at maturity.",2020-04-07,1.38,18,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015420590,NA,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/csc2.20164,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S48277251,0011-183X,https://openalex.org/P4310320595,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/csc2.20164,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/csc2.20164,publishedVersion,NA,38,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,2611,2620,60,5,other-oa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Non-renewable resources have been transformed or relocated from the air, water and land into the system and are flowing out as wastes rather than reusable, recyclable resources. This current environmental situation is promoting the development of methods able to optimize nutrient cycling, minimize use of external inputs, and maximize input use efficiency. Some humic products are derived from lignin found in wheat straw and biofertilizers as compost and manure teas can be made using residues. Also, these biostimulants might decrease the necessity of synthetic inputs. This review strives to enhance our understanding of the conjunctive use of humic substances (HS) and biofertilizers. The biostimulant effects of each of these compounds are shown in the literature. Thus, our review question is whether the combined application of HS and biofertilizers can promote synergy between both compounds and potentially more efficacy. The effects promoted by using HS plus biofertilizers on plants and microorganisms are very interconnected, so sometimes these effects can be confounded. For instance, the root elongation promoted by HS might increase hyphal fungi colonization. Therefore, this review as divided in three sections: Responses of plants, fungi and bacteria. The findings indicate that the source and application rate of HS will have a strong impact on whether plant growth and microbial activity significantly improved. The microbial species and plant type also influence the response to HS. The prospects of the conjunctive use of and biofertilizers to stimulate plant development and microbial activity in agricultural systems are theoretically substantial when considering the total number of studies included in this review.",2020-06-24,0.26,12,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3039157298,NA,TRUE,TRUE,gold,https://journalijpss.com/index.php/IJPSS/article/download/30306/56859,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S2764346760,2320-7035,https://openalex.org/P4310320855,Sciencedomain International,https://doi.org/10.9734/ijpss/2020/v32i730306,https://journalijpss.com/index.php/IJPSS/article/download/30306/56859,publishedVersion,NA,51,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,56,75,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is a resurgence of interest in cannabis due to diverse uses such as a rich source of cellulosic/woody fiber and construction uses, seed oil, bioenergy and pharmaceutical properties. The principle of an integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS) is to enable adaptation of plant nutrition and soil fertility management to local site characteristics, attempting to optimize use of inorganic, organic and biological resources. This project investigated the individual and combined use of inorganic, organic and biological fertilizer resources on cannabis before and after a period of moderate water stress. We evaluated the individual and combined effects of commercial synthetic fertilizer, humic acid (HA), manure tea and bioinoculant as inorganic, organic and biological resources, respectively on cannabis growth and physiological parameters. Our hypothesis was that the synergetic effects of HA + biofertilizers would improve cannabis growth. When compared to the control, the application of HA and biofertilizer alone, or in combination, increased plant height, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency by 55, 8 and 12%, respectively, after water stress. Cannabis biomass of treated plants was rarely different from the control. The combined application of HA + biofertilizer resulted in additive, but not synergistic, increases in measured parameter. Future research should focus on the effects of biostimulants on CBD/THC content due to the potential impact on the production of secondary metabolites in plants under stress.",2020-08-06,0.833,12,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3047416887,NA,FALSE,TRUE,green,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/10919/102637/1/agj2.20400.pdf,TRUE,https://openalex.org/S139950591,0002-1962,https://openalex.org/P4310320595,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20400,NA,NA,NA,67,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,5237,5248,112,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our hypothesis was that HA would increase the microbial activity in the biofertilizers and synergy of both compounds would promote better plant performance and stimulate soil microbial activity. In 2020, the individual and combined application of biofertilizers and HA increased cannabis height, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, aboveground biomass, and bucked biomass by 105, 52, 43, 122, and 117%, respectively. Impacts were greater under suboptimal growing conditions caused by planting delay experienced in 2020. In 2019, planting date occurred in-between the most favorable period and chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency were the only parameters influenced by the application of biostimulants. The discrepancies between the two growing seasons reinforce the evidence of other studies that biostimulants efficacy is maximized under stress conditions.

Solvita and soil NO 3 –N tests may be useful for predicting the level of early‐season N mineralization from winter cover crops (WCCs). Soil NO 3 –N collected at the V4 growth stage of corn at 0 to 15 cm was positively correlated ( R 2 = 0.45) with corn check yield. Neither the Solvita nor the presidedress nitrate test detected WCC N mineralization consistently enough to use them in rate recommendations. Environmental and economic goals encourage the use of soil N tests to improve fertilizer N (FN) management in corn ( Zea mays L.). Recently, the Solvita 1‐d CO 2 burst test, which proposes to estimate soil potentially mineralizable N (PMN), has been promoted as a tool for FN recommendations. We aimed to compare the Solvita test with the established presidedress nitrate test (PSNT) for estimating optimum sidedressed FN rates in a typical corn crop rotation in the Mid‐Atlantic United States that includes winter annual cover crops (WCCs). Research was conducted at eight locations from 2012 to 2014. Three WCC treatments [cereal rye ( Secale cereale L.), hairy vetch ( Vicia villosa Roth ssp. villosa ) or a cereal rye–hairy vetch mix] were the main plots and 10 FN rates were the subplots. The WCCs affected preplanting (PP) Solvita results at one location, V4 NO 3 –N at 0 to 15 cm (PSNT15) at four locations, and V4 NO 3 –N at 0 to 30 cm (PSNT30) at two locations. Correlations between soil N test parameters and relative corn yields ranged from 0.31 to 0.13. Values for PSNT15 and PSNT30 correlated positively with corn check yields ( r = 0.41 and 0.39 respectively). Solvita did not provide additional information to PSNT for predicting preplanting PMN, V4 PMN, or corn check yields. The advantages of the Solvita test were its simplicity, speed of analysis, and lower coefficient of variation relative to the PSNT. Neither method was consistently effective for predicting WCC effects on soil N or relative corn yield.",2018-10-18,1.005,8,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2896060828,NA,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S59755854,0361-5995,https://openalex.org/P4310320595,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2018.01.0036,NA,NA,NA,20,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,1428,1436,82,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Field studies were established to evaluate application of midseason (V8 to V10), variable liquid urea ammonia nitrate (28%), N rates (0, 45, 90 and 134 kg N ha −1 ) and different application distances (0, 10, 20 and 30 cm) away from the maize row on grain yield and NUE at Haskell and Hennessey in 2009, Efaw in 2010 and Lake Carl Blackwell, Oklahoma in 2009 and 2010. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used throughout the study. Results indicated that maize grain yield in sites with adequate rainfall increased significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) with N rate, and poor N response was recorded in sites with low rainfall. Across sites and seasons, varying side dress N application distance away from the maize row did not significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) influence maize grain yield and NUE even with no prep-plant applied. Environments with adequate rainfall distribution had better maize grain yields when high side dress N rates (90 and 134 kg N ha −1 ) were applied 0 to 10 cm, and a higher NUE when 45 kg N ha −1 was applied 0 to 20 cm away from the maize row. For low N rates (45 kg N ha −1 ), increased maize grain yield and NUE were achieved when side dress N was applied 0 to 20 cm away from the maize row at locations with low rainfall distribution. Across sites and seasons, increasing side dress N to 134 kg N ha −1 contributed to a general decline in mean NUE to as low as 4%, 35%, 10%, 51% at Hennessey, Efaw, LCB (2009) and LCB (2010) respectively.",2012-11-16,0.913,5,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2317070169,NA,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S167675576,0014-4797,https://openalex.org/P4310311721,Cambridge University Press,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0014479712000981,NA,NA,NA,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,3,18,49,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our objectives were to evaluate N dynamics following different cover crops (legume, nonlegume, none) and their relationship with subsequent corn yields within an established no‐till winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)–cover crop/corn–soybean ( Glycine max ) rotation over two site‐years in the U.S. Northern Plains. Spring cover crop biomass and N uptake, in‐situ soil N mineralization following cover crop termination, and corn grain yield and N uptake were measured. Legume cover crops were associated with higher corn yields, whereas rye ( Secale cereale ) did not significantly decrease corn yields despite N immobilization by a large rye cover crop in one year. Legume cover crops produced the highest rates of N mineralization during periods of high N demand by corn (V6–R3) and the highest seasonal amounts of mineralized N compared with rye or no cover crops. In‐situ N mineralization measurements better predicted yields across all treatments compared with approaches using cover crop biomass and N content. In situ N mineralization rates during corn growth stages V6–R3 provided a superior prediction ( r = .83) of corn yields compared with all seasonal estimates of N provided by cover crops.

The introduction of rejuvenators has made it possible to produce asphalt mixes with high recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) content. Typically rejuvenators need to be added to the RAP bitumen in high dosages, more than 10%, to achieve the desired effect. In this work a new soybean-derived additive is introduced as a rejuvenator, at 0.75% by weight of the bitumen. The effect of adding the soybean-derived rejuvenator on the rheological properties of both a performance grade (PG) 64-28 and a PG 58-28 bitumen is assessed using a dynamic shear rheometer, a bending beam rheometer and a rotational viscometer. Dynamic modulus specimens for both the control and modified blends were prepared using a mixing and compaction temperature of 120°C, as well as a temperature of 140°C, and master curves were constructed using test results. The dynamic modulus data were further analysed using a complex statistical technique which utilises a split-plot repeated measure concept. It was noted that, at such a low dosage, the rejuvenator greatly improved the fatigue and low-temperature properties of the tested asphalt binders. The dynamic modulus results revealed that the rejuvenator was successful in reducing asphalt binder stiffness, and that the extent of such a reduction depended largely on the asphalt grade. Additionally, the mixing and compaction temperature of 120°C had the effect of the mix performing better at lower test temperatures than the specimens produced using a mixing and compaction temperature of 140°C. The ageing characteristics of the rejuvenated binders were assessed using Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection, which revealed similar ageing behaviour of both the control and modified asphalt binders, as indicated by the evolution of the carbonyl and sulfoxide indices.",2017-07-06,5.087,61,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2730057981,NA,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S31518343,1468-0629,https://openalex.org/P4310320547,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/14680629.2017.1345781,NA,NA,NA,32,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,1750,1770,19,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current rutting parameter based on total rut depth (TRD) does not separate between rutting caused by plastic deformation and that caused by stripping. An alternative parameter—that is, corrected rut depth (CRD)—has been suggested to evaluate rutting that occurs solely because of plastic deformation without considering the effect of stripping. In this study, 33 plant-produced mixes were sampled from different producers in Oklahoma, representing a wide range of materials and mix types. The plant-produced mixes were tested using HWTT at 50°C and analyzed to determine their TRD and CRD. Furthermore, the potential of using the indirect tensile test at high temperature (IDT-HT) for acceptance during production was evaluated using a test temperature of 50°C. From the results, it was shown that the CRD provides a better measure of rutting compared with the TRD. A rutting criterion was proposed using a maximum CRD of 6 mm at 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 wheel passes for mixes with PG64-22, PG70-28, and PG76-28, respectively. A moisture susceptibility criterion using a minimum stripping number (SN) of 2,000 passes was suggested, which approximately coincides with a minimum stripping inflection point (SIP) of 10,000 passes. Using the IDT-HT, a minimum strength of 240 kPa (35 pounds per square inch) was proposed as an acceptance threshold during production.",2025-04-29,0,0,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4409942847,NA,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S145575934,0361-1981,https://openalex.org/P4310320017,SAGE Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981251324206,NA,NA,NA,15,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both chemical and rheological properties of asphalt binder are expected to change as aging continues. The pavement industry is increasing the use of different recycled materials in the construction and rehabilitation of flexible pavements to preserve natural resources, save costs, and reduce environmental emissions. The aged binder from recycled materials is expected to alter the binder properties and its aging characteristics in the new mix. In this study, 3 different virgin base binder types (PG 64-16, PG 58-22, and PG 70-10) and 7 different binder blends containing recycled binders (up to 100 % binder replacement) were subjected to different aging conditions. The rheological and chemical properties of these binders were characterized using a dynamic shear rheometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. It was found that the Glover-Rowe parameter distinctively captured the change in binder rheological properties with aging for the different binder blends. A good correlation (R2 value of 0.83–1.00) was observed between binder chemical and rheological properties. The source and performance grade of the base binder were found to govern the correlation between the rheological and chemical properties of the blended binder. Hamburg wheel tracking (for rutting and moisture sensitivity) and indirect tensile asphalt cracking test (for fracture) tests were conducted on asphalt mixes maintaining the same blended binder ratios. The laboratory mix performance parameters were found to correlate well with the properties of the blended binders. Therefore, properties of the blended binders can be an important source of information for predicting the performance of asphalt mixes containing recycled materials.",2023-03-09,1.796,8,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4323665773,NA,FALSE,TRUE,green,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7wv2g75b/qt7wv2g75b.pdf?t=rsw9nk,TRUE,https://openalex.org/S2764646896,2165-3984,NA,NA,https://doi.org/10.1520/acem20220105,NA,NA,NA,33,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,41,57,12,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The type of interaction that takes place between the rejuvenator and the binder is still under extensive study. This research aims at investigating the extent by which the performance grade (PG) and source of the original binder affect the performance of a soybean-derived rejuvenator. The rejuvenator was added at a dosage of 6% and 12% by weight of the binder to three distinctly different binders, namely a PG58-28 binder, an extracted reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) binder, and a residuum oil super critical extraction (ROSE) unit bottom binder. The binders were selected so that they varied significantly in terms of their properties, performance grade, and source. The rheological properties of the rejuvenated binders were studied using a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and bending beam rheometer (BBR) at different stages of aging. Using the DSR, temperature-frequency sweeps were conducted and the complex shear modulus master curves as well as the phase angle master curves were constructed. The data from the master curves were used to assess changes in fatigue and rutting parameters with rejuvenation. The fatigue behavior was further investigated using linear amplitude sweep testing.

For the optimum ultrasonication energy, Raman spectroscopy is used to assess the degree of imperfections on CNTs. CNTs-reinforced mortar specimens prepared using Triton X-100 and SDS are tested for compressive and flexural strength. Triton X-100 is shown to exhibit better dispersion efficiency than SDS, leading to greater improvement in flexural and compressive strength.

However, the surface area factors are affected by the different specific gravities of the aggregates, which are always ignored during the calculation of BFT. Moreover, whether the BFT is uniformly distributed in asphalt mixture is controversial. Hence, it is necessary to further study the distribution of asphalt film thickness in asphalt materials and its influence factor. This study analyzed the distribution of BFT in coarse and fine parts of recycled asphalt pavements (RAPs). Firstly, a part of four types of RAP (Teichert, Syar, Vulcan coarse, and Vulcan fine) were sieved by #8 sieve (2.36 mm) to achieve coarse and fine parts of RAP. Secondly, the binder content and aggregate gradation were investigated through the ignition and extraction method. Thirdly, surface area ratio was used to evaluate the influence of the ignition and extraction method on the surface area of aggregate sieved from RAP. Finally, the BFT of different types of RAP were calculated through two different methods to evaluate the effect of specific gravities of the aggregates on BFT. The results indicate that for the coefficient of variation, 30 out of 32 data were less than 15.0 %, which implies the BFT was almost evenly distributed in coarse and fine parts of RAP. In addition, the difference of surface area factors caused by the different specific gravities of the aggregates exerts negligible influence on the surface area and the calculation of BFT.",2019-12-12,1.549,12,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994728842,NA,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S163152955,0090-3973,https://openalex.org/P4310316053,ASM International,https://doi.org/10.1520/jte20190624,NA,NA,NA,24,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,2474,2493,48,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To enable large-scale deployments, the fillers used in creating a conductive material must be inexpensive and easy to mix homogeneously. Carbon black (CB) particles constitute a promising filler due to their low cost and ease of dispersion. However, a relatively high quantity of these particles needs to be mixed with cement in order to reach the percolation threshold. Such level may influence the physical properties of the cementitious material itself, such as compressive and tensile strengths. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of utilizing a polymer to create conductive chains of CB more quickly than in a cementitious-only medium. This way, while the resulting material would have a higher conductivity, the percolation threshold would be reached with fewer CB particles. Building on the principle that the percolation threshold provides great sensing sensitivity, it would be possible to fabricate sensors using less conducting particles. We present results from a preliminary investigation comparing the utilization of a conductive paint fabricated from a poly-Styrene-co-Ethylene-co-Butylene-co-Styrene (SEBS) polymer matrix and CB, and CB-only as fillers to create cementitious sensors. Preliminary results show that the percolation threshold can be attained with significantly less CB using the SEBS+CB mix. Also, the study of the strain sensing properties indicates that the SEBS+CB sensor has a strain sensitivity comparable to the one of a CB-only cementitious sensor when comparing specimens fabricated at their respective percolation thresholds.",2015-04-01,0.445,4,NA,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1976023367,NA,FALSE,TRUE,green,https://dr.lib.iastate.edu/bitstreams/1d2e054b-7bee-4c06-8f9c-8db4b35dbd6b/download,TRUE,https://openalex.org/S183492911,0277-786X,https://openalex.org/P4310315543,SPIE,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2084408,NA,NA,NA,15,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,en,NA,NA,943722,943722,9437,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent earthquake incidents have shown a compelling need to revise these codes. In this paper, an analytical study is performed using non-linear finite element modelling to investigate this mode of failure. A quasi-static hydrodynamic load is applied to the tank walls simulating the effect of the accelerated contained liquid.

Sequences were compared to published reference sequences of known species and a phylogenetic tree constructed. Twenty-three ticks (26.7%) consistent with R. linnaei were identified on seven dogs, including dogs from British Columbia and Ontario, with a median infestation intensity of 2 ticks/dog (mean = 3.3 ticks/dog).
