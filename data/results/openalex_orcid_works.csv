The main difficulty with crushing is that it can drastically change the topology of a triangulation, so applications to date have been limited to relatively simple surfaces: $2$-spheres, discs, annuli, and closed boundary-parallel surfaces. We give the first detailed analysis of the topological effects of crushing closed essential surfaces of positive genus. To showcase the utility of this new analysis, we use it to prove some results about how triangulation complexity interacts with JSJ decompositions and satellite knots; although similar applications can also be obtained using techniques of Matveev, our approach has the advantage that it avoids the machinery of almost simple spines and handle decompositions.",2024-03-18,NA,0,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4392974081,,TRUE,TRUE,green,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11523,TRUE,https://openalex.org/S4306400194,NA,https://openalex.org/I205783295,Cornell University,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11523,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11523,NA,submittedVersion,,0,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, this can lead to misplaced faith in conjectures if the smallest counterexamples are too large to appear in our census. Since the number of triangulations increases super-exponentially with size, there is no way to expand a census beyond relatively small triangulations; the current census only goes up to $10$ tetrahedra. Here, we show that it is feasible to search for large and hard-to-find counterexamples by using heuristics to selectively (rather than exhaustively) enumerate triangulations.

A major algorithmic tool behind some of the best known algorithms for these problems is normal surface theory. However, we currently have a poor understanding of the computational complexity of problems in normal surface theory: many such problems are still not known to have polynomial-time algorithms, yet proofs of $\mathrm{NP}$-hardness also remain scarce. We give three results that provide some insight on this front. A number of modern normal surface theoretic algorithms depend critically on the operation of finding a non-trivial normal sphere or disc in a $3$-dimensional triangulation. We formulate an abstract problem that captures the algebraic and combinatorial aspects of this operation, and show that this abstract problem is $\mathrm{NP}$-complete. Assuming $\mathrm{P}\neq\mathrm{NP}$, this result suggests that any polynomial-time procedure for finding a non-trivial normal sphere or disc will need to exploit some geometric or topological intuition. Another key operation, which applies to a much wider range of topological problems, involves finding a vertex normal surface of a certain type. We study two closely-related problems that can be solved using this operation. For one of these problems, we give a simple alternative solution that runs in polynomial time; for the other, we prove $\mathrm{NP}$-completeness.",2019-01-01,NA,0,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996610703,,TRUE,TRUE,green,https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09051,TRUE,https://openalex.org/S4306400194,NA,https://openalex.org/I205783295,Cornell University,https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09051,NA,other-oa,submittedVersion,,21,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,NA,NA,NA,NA

The primary purpose is to assess the thermo-hydrodynamic performance of both single and hybrid nanofluids in terms of varying Reynolds numbers and nanoparticle volume concentrations in a double-dimpled pipe. In the double-dimpled corrugated design, the smooth flow is interrupted, allowing small whirlpool zones to form and generating turbulence, which boosts heat exchanger efficiency and prevents particles from dropping out of suspension. The unique design of corrugation enhances heat transfer, allowing for a smaller heat exchanger. Corrugated heat exchangers can be half the size of smooth ones, depending on the application where compact size is required in operation of industries. Assuming a constant and uniform heat flux of 10,000 W/m2, the numerical simulations are conducted at Reynolds numbers ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. The research utilizes computational methods to assess the thermo-hydrodynamic performance of nanofluids (CuO/water, Al2O3/water, TiO2/water) and hybrid nanofluids (Al2O3CuO/water, Al2O3-TiO2/water), along with the effects of double-dimpled surfaces in the pipe with volume concentrations varying from 1% to 3%. The computational fluid dynamics solver is applied to analyze the effective properties of nanofluids based on models. There is a discussion on the results of heat transfer coefficient, temperature distributions, Nusselt number, pressure drop, and friction factors under various working conditions. Different nanoparticle compositions were shown to have a 20–25% higher heat transfer coefficient for the double-dimpled pipe in contrast to the smooth one. A higher Nusselt number is obtained owing to the complexity of the corrugations, that improves heat transfer and pressure drop with high volume fractions. As the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) for corrugated geometries is greater than unity, they can surpass smooth pipes. The 3% Al2O3CuO/water hybrid nanofluid was determined to be the top - performing nanofluid in the double-dimpled pipe flow, with a maximum thermal performance gain of 20.62%.",2023-01-11,6.844,41,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4315618868,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijft.2023.100283,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S4210194017,2666-2027,https://openalex.org/P4310320990,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijft.2023.100283,NA,cc-by-nc-nd,publishedVersion,,56,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,100283,100283,17,NA

A novel combined approach has been presented here to optimize the heat transfer, incorporating both geometry modification and coolant optimization. The computational model evolved for single-phase, and turbulent flow conditions in three-dimensional corrugated minichannels (i.e. rectangular, sine-shaped, and V-shaped) with Reynolds number varying from 10,000 to 30,000. Considering a uniform heat flux of 10,000 W/m2, the investigation evaluates the thermal-hydraulic performance of single nanofluids (CuO/water, Al2O3/water, TiO2/water) and hybrid nanofluids (Al2O3-CuO/water, Al2O3-TiO2/water), with volume fractions ranging from 1% to 3%. Various nanoparticle compositions exhibited a 25-30% increased heat transfer coefficient in the corrugated minichannel relative to the smooth one. An enhanced Nusselt number is evident due to the sophisticated corrugated arrangement dependent on the amplitude and patterns of the corrugations. The obtained energy ratio quantifies the effectiveness of a heat exchanger, whereas the Bejan number signifies the heat transfer being characterized by higher irreversibility, leading to a notable dissipation of energy. To account for the PEC (performance evaluation criterion) value above one, the corrugated geometries can outperform smooth channels.

Merr.) rotation was a) no less productive than the highly unstable, corn-soybean rotation (p = 0.11); and b) only marginally less stable than the most stable rotation (p = 0.06). Crop selection and sequencing were critical to this outcome. High productivity was due to a) overyielding of individual crops in diversified rotations that increased with time; b) sequencing to allow higher-yielding winter crops; and c) beneficial crop legacy effects. Stability was highest in rotations that included crops belonging to more weather-niches (r2 = 0.67; p < 0.001). Surprisingly, these weather-niches groups did not correspond to traditional categories like cool- vs warm-season crops. These results suggest four principles for the design, study, and implementation of diversified grain rotations that are stable under erratic weather and are as productive as current standard practices.",2024-04-01,3.075,5,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4393393791,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2024.109361,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S148071443,0378-4290,https://openalex.org/P4310320990,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2024.109361,NA,cc-by,publishedVersion,,52,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,109361,109361,310,NA

Our objectives were to investigate crop rotation effects on shoot dry weight and root characteristics of cereal and grain legume crops at anthesis, as well as on grain yield. Rotations were corn ( Zea mays L.)–soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (CS), corn–soybean–spring wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)–field pea ( Pisum sativum L.)

Crop biomass and root samples were collected at crop anthesis for each crop within the crop rotation. Two soil cores were taken within each of the crops grown in rotation, and the two soil cores were cut into segments of 0–15, 15–30, 30–45, 45–60, 60–90, and 90–120 cm and combined for measuring root length density.

Rotation treatments had significant effects only on soybean root length density at 0‐ to 90‐cm soil depths. Soybean following winter wheat (CPWwS and COWwS) had significantly less root length density than soybean following corn.

Some humic products are derived from lignin found in wheat straw and biofertilizers as compost and manure teas can be made using residues. Also, these biostimulants might decrease the necessity of synthetic inputs. This review strives to enhance our understanding of the conjunctive use of humic substances (HS) and biofertilizers.

Thus, our review question is whether the combined application of HS and biofertilizers can promote synergy between both compounds and potentially more efficacy. The effects promoted by using HS plus biofertilizers on plants and microorganisms are very interconnected, so sometimes these effects can be confounded. For instance, the root elongation promoted by HS might increase hyphal fungi colonization. Therefore, this review as divided in three sections: Responses of plants, fungi and bacteria. The findings indicate that the source and application rate of HS will have a strong impact on whether plant growth and microbial activity significantly improved.

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate and compare the yield and agronomic characteristics of grain sorghum planted full season or double‐cropped after wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), or triticale (× Triticosecale ) with soybean in the same rotations. Four field experiments were conducted in Virginia at the Southern Piedmont Agriculture Research and Extension Center (SPAREC) (Appling sandy loam) and Tidewater Agriculture Research and Extension Center (TAREC) (Nansemond loamy sand) in 2012 to 2014. The experimental design was a split‐plot with 14 treatments and four replications. Main plot was winter crop (barley, triticale, or wheat) and the subplot either soybean or sorghum. In three of four instances, full‐season grain sorghum yields were greater than double‐crop, while this was true in half of trials for soybean. Still, double‐crop grain sorghum yields averaged over 2.9 Mg ha −1 indicating strong potential for this use in the region. Estimated net return to land and management was generally higher for soybean than sorghum except sorghum double‐crop following triticale. The highest net return was estimated for soybean double‐cropped following wheat (US$745.64 ha −1 ), and the lowest net return was sorghum following barley ($189.55 ha −1 ), due to the lower sorghum grain yield and the lower value of barley.",2017-05-05,1.741,8,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2610425967,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S139950591,0002-1962,https://openalex.org/P4310320595,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.2134/agronj2016.10.0577,NA,NA,NA,,16,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,1532,1539,109,4

Solvita and soil NO 3 –N tests may be useful for predicting the level of early‐season N mineralization from winter cover crops (WCCs). Soil NO 3 –N collected at the V4 growth stage of corn at 0 to 15 cm was positively correlated ( R 2 = 0.45) with corn check yield. Neither the Solvita nor the presidedress nitrate test detected WCC N mineralization consistently enough to use them in rate recommendations. Environmental and economic goals encourage the use of soil N tests to improve fertilizer N (FN) management in corn ( Zea mays L.). Recently, the Solvita 1‐d CO 2 burst test, which proposes to estimate soil potentially mineralizable N (PMN), has been promoted as a tool for FN recommendations. We aimed to compare the Solvita test with the established presidedress nitrate test (PSNT) for estimating optimum sidedressed FN rates in a typical corn crop rotation in the Mid‐Atlantic United States that includes winter annual cover crops (WCCs). Research was conducted at eight locations from 2012 to 2014. Three WCC treatments [cereal rye ( Secale cereale L.), hairy vetch ( Vicia villosa Roth ssp. villosa ) or a cereal rye–hairy vetch mix] were the main plots and 10 FN rates were the subplots. The WCCs affected preplanting (PP) Solvita results at one location, V4 NO 3 –N at 0 to 15 cm (PSNT15) at four locations, and V4 NO 3 –N at 0 to 30 cm (PSNT30) at two locations. Correlations between soil N test parameters and relative corn yields ranged from 0.31 to 0.13. Values for PSNT15 and PSNT30 correlated positively with corn check yields ( r = 0.41 and 0.39 respectively). Solvita did not provide additional information to PSNT for predicting preplanting PMN, V4 PMN, or corn check yields. The advantages of the Solvita test were its simplicity, speed of analysis, and lower coefficient of variation relative to the PSNT. Neither method was consistently effective for predicting WCC effects on soil N or relative corn yield.",2018-10-18,1.005,8,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2896060828,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S59755854,0361-5995,https://openalex.org/P4310320595,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2018.01.0036,NA,NA,NA,,20,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,1428,1436,82,6

This study was conducted to determine the effect of delayed emergence on corn yields and the effect of nitrogen (N) applications to compensate for yield reductions. The design used was a randomized complete block, with 4 sequences of delayed planting (0,4,7,and 10 days after planting) and 3 rates of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 40, 80 kg N ha−1). At maturity, individual plants were tagged in sets of three and hand harvested. Corn ears were shelled, and yield per plant calculated. Grain yield of the delayed plant compared to that of the neighbors was reduced by 27, 8, 20 and 12 kg ha−1day−1 for 2007 LCB1, 2007 LCB2, 2010 LCB1 and 2010 LCB2, respectively.

Two independent studies examined (1) five rye seeding rates ranging from 0 to 90 kg ha−1 and (2) five termination dates ranging from April 19 to May 31 (585 to 1084 growing degree days) to understand management induced relationships between rye biomass, nutrient concentrations, and composition of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. Rye biomass increased at seeding rates of 90 kg ha−1 as compared to the 22–67 kg ha−1 seeding rates while trends toward higher plant structural components were observed as seeding rate increased. Rye biomass accumulated rapidly beyond 819 (May 13) growing degree days while increasing rye C:N ratio and concentrations of hemicellulose and cellulose. Rye C:N ratio was strongly correlated to rye biomass (R2 = 0.80, p < .001) with a C:N ratio of 25 associated with 2000 kg ha−1 of rye biomass.

An Integrated Plant Nutrition System (IPNS) uses the combined and harmonious use of inorganic, organic and biological nutrient resources to maximize efficiency of inputs. We evaluated the effects of commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizer, humic acid compounds (HA), compost/manure teas and bioinoculants as inorganic, organic and biological resources, respectively and their synergy over three years on corn (Zea mays L.) in the Mid-Atlantic USA. The individual and combined application of HA and biofertilizer following the IPNS influenced corn height and leaf greenness to varying degrees, most likely due to biostimulant effects. In 2017, corn height, NDVI, greenness and vigor responded positively to biostimulant application to varying magnitudes and growth stages, however grain yield and nutrient content were not affected. In combined studies from 2018 and 2019 corn height was not impacted by biostimulant application but NDVI, photosynthetic efficiency, greenness and vigor were increased at different doses and corn growth stages. The combined use of HA + biofertilizer (Microlife Humic + Microgeo) was the only treatment leading to increased grain yield. This study demonstrates that the individual and combined application of HA and biofertilizer can influence corn growth and vigor at various points during the growing season.

Many tools to assist in the determination of optimum corn sidedress N rates exist, however, those that are low cost, that can be used in real time and that do not require extensive scouting or sampling may be preferred. This study compared the rates prescribed by four in-season N rate recommendation approaches: (1) the Virginia Corn Algorithm (VCA); (2) the Maize-N simulation model; (3) the Nutrient Expert for Maize (NE-Maize) model; and (4) the standard yield goal-based approach used in Virginia for N rate prescription, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and corn performance. The VCA uses canopy reflectance from pre-existing high and low N areas to determine potential response to additional N fertilizer. Maize-N generates recommendations based on crop and soil-specific input parameters as well as long-term and current season weather data. The NE-Maize model requires input of site and crop specific data, as well as the history of inputs and crop rotation and generates recommendations based on previous result from studies conducted in similar environments. The purpose of this study was to compare N rate recommendations from these various systems for performance and utility in the mid-Atlantic region. A total of seven field trials were conducted from 2012 to 2014 in Virginia each with four replications in a randomized complete block design. Treatments evaluated included a complete factorial of four different pre-plant rates (0, 45, 90, and 134 kg ha−1) with the three different simulation model-prescribed rates and the yield-goal approach applied at sidedress. There were no differences in corn grain yield between the different systems or pre-plant N rate application at any location. Corn grain and stover N uptake were infrequently affected by treatment, but generally increased with increasing N rate applied, when a difference existed. Partial factor productivity (PFP) of N generally declined with increasing pre-plant N rate for all in-season N recommendation systems. The PFP for the in-season N rate recommendations generated from the VCA approach was greatest in four of seven instances with a mean of 68 kg grain kg N−1. Additionally, based on our results the Maize-N model, 56 kg grain kg N−1, also shows promise in this environment. While additional research is needed to validate these findings, producers should consider the use of sidedress N rate decision support tools to increase efficiency of N fertilizer.",2017-09-21,0,1,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2760614946,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S53118794,0190-4167,https://openalex.org/P4310320547,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2017.1382531,NA,NA,NA,,21,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,2818,2828,40,20

Our hypothesis was that HA would increase the microbial activity in the biofertilizers and synergy of both compounds would promote better plant performance and stimulate soil microbial activity. In 2020, the individual and combined application of biofertilizers and HA increased cannabis height, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, aboveground biomass, and bucked biomass by 105, 52, 43, 122 and 117%, respectively. Impacts were greater under suboptimal growing conditions caused by planting delay experienced in 2020. In 2019, planting date occurred in-between the most favorable period and chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency were the only parameters influenced by the application of biostimulants. The discrepancies between the two growing seasons reinforce the evidence of other studies that biostimulants efficacy is maximized under stress conditions. This study could not conclusively confirm that the combined use of biofertilizer + HA is a superior practice since affected plant parameters did not differ from application of the compounds singly. Similarly, only one biofertilizer + HA treatment increased soil microbial activity.

Rotations have become less diverse recently. Re-diversifying may help agricultural systems meet the growing, dynamic demands from society and challenges from climate change. Using a long-term experiment, we tested whether diversified rotations could (a) match the productivity (grain yield) of simplified rotations while (b) stabilizing productivity against variable weather in the western Corn Belt. We identified rotation design choices that drive these productivity-stability dynamics. Although more productive rotations were more susceptible to weather (r = 0.63; p < 0.001), this tradeoff was surmountable (p < 0.001): the corn-oat-winter wheat-soybean (Zea mays L., Avena sativa L., Triticum aestivum L., Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation was (a) no less productive than the highly unstable, corn-soybean rotation (p = 0.11); and (b) only marginally less stable than the most stable rotation (p = 0.06). Crop selection and sequencing were critical to this outcome. High productivity was due to (a) overyielding of individual crops in diversified rotations that increased with time; (b) sequencing to allow higher-yielding winter crops; and (c) beneficial crop legacy effects. Stability was highest in rotations that included crops belonging to more weather-niches (r2 = 0.67; p < 0.001). Surprisingly, these weather-niches did not correspond with traditional functional groups such as cool- vs warm-season crops. These results suggest four principles to the design of diversified grain rotations that are stable under erratic weather and are as productive as current standard practices.",2023-09-30,0,0,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4387365730,,TRUE,TRUE,green,https://doi.org/10.31220/agrirxiv.2023.00202,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://doi.org/10.31220/agrirxiv.2023.00202,NA,public-domain,submittedVersion,,0,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, high stocking rates under ICLS decreased the SOC. Low stocking rate under ICLS increased the soil N but it did not impact on soil P significantly. High stocking rate decreased the BG and MBC but low stocking rate increased. High stocking rate increased the soil penetration resistance 2.43 to 2.83 MPa.

The introduction of rejuvenators has made it possible to produce asphalt mixes with high recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) content. Typically rejuvenators need to be added to the RAP bitumen in high dosages, more than 10%, to achieve the desired effect. In this work a new soybean-derived additive is introduced as a rejuvenator, at 0.75% by weight of the bitumen. The effect of adding the soybean-derived rejuvenator on the rheological properties of both a performance grade (PG) 64-28 and a PG 58-28 bitumen is assessed using a dynamic shear rheometer, a bending beam rheometer and a rotational viscometer. Dynamic modulus specimens for both the control and modified blends were prepared using a mixing and compaction temperature of 120°C, as well as a temperature of 140°C, and master curves were constructed using test results. The dynamic modulus data were further analysed using a complex statistical technique which utilises a split-plot repeated measure concept. It was noted that, at such a low dosage, the rejuvenator greatly improved the fatigue and low-temperature properties of the tested asphalt binders. The dynamic modulus results revealed that the rejuvenator was successful in reducing asphalt binder stiffness, and that the extent of such a reduction depended largely on the asphalt grade. Additionally, the mixing and compaction temperature of 120°C had the effect of the mix performing better at lower test temperatures than the specimens produced using a mixing and compaction temperature of 140°C. The ageing characteristics of the rejuvenated binders were assessed using Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection, which revealed similar ageing behaviour of both the control and modified asphalt binders, as indicated by the evolution of the carbonyl and sulfoxide indices.",2017-07-06,5.087,61,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2730057981,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S31518343,1468-0629,https://openalex.org/P4310320547,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/14680629.2017.1345781,NA,NA,NA,,32,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,1750,1770,19,8

An alternative parameter—that is, corrected rut depth (CRD)—has been suggested to evaluate rutting that occurs solely because of plastic deformation without considering the effect of stripping. In this study, 33 plant-produced mixes were sampled from different producers in Oklahoma, representing a wide range of materials and mix types. The plant-produced mixes were tested using HWTT at 50°C and analyzed to determine their TRD and CRD. Furthermore, the potential of using the indirect tensile test at high temperature (IDT-HT) for acceptance during production was evaluated using a test temperature of 50°C. From the results, it was shown that the CRD provides a better measure of rutting compared with the TRD. A rutting criterion was proposed using a maximum CRD of 6 mm at 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 wheel passes for mixes with PG64-22, PG70-28, and PG76-28, respectively. A moisture susceptibility criterion using a minimum stripping number (SN) of 2,000 passes was suggested, which approximately coincides with a minimum stripping inflection point (SIP) of 10,000 passes. Using the IDT-HT, a minimum strength of 240 kPa (35 pounds per square inch) was proposed as an acceptance threshold during production.",2025-04-29,0,0,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4409942847,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S145575934,0361-1981,https://openalex.org/P4310320017,SAGE Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981251324206,NA,NA,NA,,15,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both chemical and rheological properties of asphalt binder are expected to change as aging continues. The pavement industry is increasing the use of different recycled materials in the construction and rehabilitation of flexible pavements to preserve natural resources, save costs, and reduce environmental emissions. The aged binder from recycled materials is expected to alter the binder properties and its aging characteristics in the new mix. In this study, 3 different virgin base binder types (PG 64-16, PG 58-22, and PG 70-10) and 7 different binder blends containing recycled binders (up to 100 % binder replacement) were subjected to different aging conditions. The rheological and chemical properties of these binders were characterized using a dynamic shear rheometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. It was found that the Glover-Rowe parameter distinctively captured the change in binder rheological properties with aging for the different binder blends. A good correlation (R2 value of 0.83–1.00) was observed between binder chemical and rheological properties. The source and performance grade of the base binder were found to govern the correlation between the rheological and chemical properties of the blended binder. Hamburg wheel tracking (for rutting and moisture sensitivity) and indirect tensile asphalt cracking test (for fracture) tests were conducted on asphalt mixes maintaining the same blended binder ratios. The laboratory mix performance parameters were found to correlate well with the properties of the blended binders.

Rejuvenators are added to mixes containing RAP to reduce the stiffness of the RAP binders and improve their low temperature properties hence allowing for higher amounts of RAP to be included in the mix. For RAP mixes utilising more than 25% RAP, blending charts are often used to determine the proportions of the virgin and RAP binders based on their respective performance grades. Introducing rejuvenators into the blend changes the overall physical properties of the blend, hence the need to assess the validity of blending charts when rejuvenators are present. In this paper, the rheological properties of a soybean-derived rejuvenator are studied using a rotational viscometer. Asphalt blends made with an extracted RAP, a virgin PG58-28 binder, and a soybean-derived rejuvenator are prepared using different proportions. The performance grades of the extracted and recovered RAP and the resulting rejuvenated RAP blends are determined using a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and a bending beam rheometer (BBR). The results revealed that the rejuvenator successfully reduced both the high and low temperature performance grades of the control blend. The impact of the rejuvenator on the viscosity of the blend is studied and two different viscosity models were used to predict the blend viscosity.

However, the surface area factors are affected by the different specific gravities of the aggregates, which are always ignored during the calculation of BFT. Moreover, whether the BFT is uniformly distributed in asphalt mixture is controversial. Hence, it is necessary to further study the distribution of asphalt film thickness in asphalt materials and its influence factor. This study analyzed the distribution of BFT in coarse and fine parts of recycled asphalt pavements (RAPs). Firstly, a part of four types of RAP (Teichert, Syar, Vulcan coarse, and Vulcan fine) were sieved by #8 sieve (2.36 mm) to achieve coarse and fine parts of RAP. Secondly, the binder content and aggregate gradation were investigated through the ignition and extraction method. Thirdly, surface area ratio was used to evaluate the influence of the ignition and extraction method on the surface area of aggregate sieved from RAP. Finally, the BFT of different types of RAP were calculated through two different methods to evaluate the effect of specific gravities of the aggregates on BFT. The results indicate that for the coefficient of variation, 30 out of 32 data were less than 15.0 %, which implies the BFT was almost evenly distributed in coarse and fine parts of RAP.

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of utilizing a polymer to create conductive chains of CB more quickly than in a cementitious-only medium. This way, while the resulting material would have a higher conductivity, the percolation threshold would be reached with fewer CB particles. Building on the principle that the percolation threshold provides great sensing sensitivity, it would be possible to fabricate sensors using less conducting particles. We present results from a preliminary investigation comparing the utilization of a conductive paint fabricated from a poly-Styrene-co-Ethylene-co-Butylene-co-Styrene (SEBS) polymer matrix and CB, and CB-only as fillers to create cementitious sensors. Preliminary results show that the percolation threshold can be attained with significantly less CB using the SEBS+CB mix. Also, the study of the strain sensing properties indicates that the SEBS+CB sensor has a strain sensitivity comparable to the one of a CB-only cementitious sensor when comparing specimens fabricated at their respective percolation thresholds.",2015-04-01,0.445,4,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1976023367,,FALSE,TRUE,green,https://dr.lib.iastate.edu/bitstreams/1d2e054b-7bee-4c06-8f9c-8db4b35dbd6b/download,TRUE,https://openalex.org/S183492911,0277-786X,https://openalex.org/P4310315543,SPIE,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2084408,NA,NA,NA,,15,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,943722,943722,9437,NA

Consequently, FAM mix testing can be an appropriate means of assessing the predictive power of these models. In this study, FAM mixes prepared with two virgin binders, PG58-28 and PG64-16, and then with different percentages of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) were tested to determine their stiffness and phase angle using temperature-frequency sweeps in a dynamic shear rheometer. The data from the control mixes with no RAP were used along with the rheological properties of the virgin binders to fit the Hirsch and Al-Khateeb models. The fitted models were then used to estimate the properties of the binders in the 15% and 25% RAP FAM mixes. A comparison of the estimated binder properties with the measured binder properties clearly indicated that the fitting parameters are binder dependent. Moreover, the estimated binder moduli deviate from the measured moduli, particularly at high temperatures. The estimated complex shear moduli from the model were found to be consistently higher than the measured shear moduli values of the chemically extracted binders.

Recent earthquake incidents have shown a compelling need to revise these codes. In this paper, an analytical study is performed using non-linear finite element modelling to investigate this mode of failure. A quasi-static hydrodynamic load is applied to the tank walls simulating the effect of the accelerated contained liquid.

The coefficient of variation revealed that the lowest variability from both tests was in fracture strength. In addition, the linear regression analysis between fracture parameters and fatigue performance indicated that slopes, fracture toughness, and strength from fracture tests have good correlations with the initial flexural stiffness from 4PB tests, while 4PB initial stiffness is well correlated with fatigue life.

Thixotropic effects are associated with load applications and are fully recoverable when the loading is discontinued. Fatigue loading results in a decrease in the asphalt binder’s modulus related to reversible phenomena such as thixotropy, healing, and self-heating, in addition to irreversible permanent fatigue damage. The study of thixotropy is important to better characterize damage because of fatigue. In this study, four different asphalt binders were tested to determine their thixotropic behavior, namely two neat PG64-16 binders from different refineries, a polymer modified PG64-28 binder, and a tire rubber modified PG64-28 binder. The binders were short-term aged using a rolling thin film oven and tested with a dynamic shear rheometer at temperatures that produced an initial modulus of 35 MPa at sinusoidal strain amplitudes of 1.2 and 1.4 %, and an initial modulus of 50 MPa at strain amplitudes of 1 and 1.2 %. The test temperatures corresponding to the initial moduli for each binder were determined using a temperature sweep at a test frequency of 10 Hz. The test temperature and strain amplitudes were applied for 500 or 1,000 s followed by rest periods to determine the effects of loading time on the rates of binder modulus recovery for the different conditions. The results indicated that the thixotropic recovery rate is dependent on the binder type, with the tire rubber modified binder showing the fastest recovery rate and the polymer modified binder showing the slowest recovery rate. The recovery rate was also shown to increase with increasing initial modulus and strain amplitude.",2022-02-18,0.26,2,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4213361954,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S163152955,0090-3973,https://openalex.org/P4310316053,ASM International,https://doi.org/10.1520/jte20210522,NA,NA,NA,,27,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,1364,1376,50,3

In this study, four asphalt mixes were collected from different regions within California before and after silo storage. The plant-produced mixes were sampled at the hot drop point directly from the plant discharge, as well as from the silo after storage for 5–16 h.

They are typically used with mixes containing more than 25 % RAP to determine the performance grade of the virgin binder or to obtain the maximum allowable RAP content. The aging condition of the RAP binders extracted from RAP can vary greatly based on years of service, climatic conditions, and traffic loading. The current specifications do not consider the stiffness of the RAP in determining the cutoff RAP percentage above which blending charts should be used. According to the current specifications, mixes containing less than 15 % RAP do not require a change to their virgin binder grade regardless of the RAP source. In this paper, extracted and recovered RAP binder from two sources representing different climatic conditions is blended with two virgin binders at different proportions. The rheological properties of the virgin and RAP binders and the resulting binder blends were compared using master curves and Black diagrams, and changes in the rheological parameters such as the crossover frequency and rheological index were noted. The blending chart procedure was used to determine the maximum allowable RAP binder ratio (RAPBR) for different mixes. The results show that the 25 % limit, currently specified, appears appropriate for the not very stiff RAP binder having a performance grade of PG94-4. However, for the stiff RAP binder (PG106+2), blending charts should be used for blends containing more than 18–20 % RAPBR.

Although the country is highly prone to flooding, the use of state-of-the-art deep learning models in predicting river water levels to aid flood forecasting is underexplored. Deep learning and attention-based models have shown high potential for accurately forecasting floods over space and time. The present study aims to develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and its attention-based architectures to predict flood water levels in the rivers of Bangladesh. The models developed in this study incorporated gauge-based water level data over 7 days for flood prediction at Dhaka and Sylhet stations. This study developed five models: artificial neural network (ANN), LSTM, spatial attention LSTM (SALSTM), temporal attention LSTM (TALSTM), and spatiotemporal attention LSTM (STALSTM). The multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) method was applied to address missing data in the time series analysis. The results showed that the use of both spatial and temporal attention together increases the predictive performance of the LSTM model, which outperforms other attention-based LSTM models.

To address this problem, we propose a solution combining IoT and Machine Learning (ML) that will not only detect pollution levels in the atmosphere accurately but also predict future pollutant levels. The proposed solution consists of two parts: an IoT device with four sensors connected with a processing unit and a software model. The sensors can track the air quality around us by measuring Particulate Matter, Carbon monoxide, Ammonia, Temperature, and Humidity. A microcontroller processes the data from the properly calibrated sensors and sends them to realtime cloud storage through a Wi-Fi module. A remote server then fetches and analyzes the data. We then determine the prime pollutant from the data, which is Particulate Matter. Next, we use the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict the pollution levels from harmful gases & the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the next day with high accuracy. Precisely, we predict the 24-hourly observations of the following day after training our optimized model with 144 hourly observations of the previous six days. We then evaluate the model with MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) score, which is 2.82 percent for temperature, 4.70 percent for humidity, 6.92 percent for Particulate Matter 2.5, 10.12 percent for Carbon monoxide, 10.3 percent for Ammonia, and 5.79 percent for AQI.

It is common to utilize statistical and machine learning models to estimate soil moisture from traditional data sources such as weather forecasts, soil properties, and crop properties. However, there is a growing interest in utilizing aerial and geospatial imagery to estimate soil moisture. Although these images capture high-resolution crop details, they are expensive to curate and challenging to interpret. Imagine, an AI-enhanced software tool that predicts soil moisture using visual cues captured by smartphones and statistical data given by weather forecasts. This work is a first step towards that goal of developing a multi-modal approach for soil moisture estimation. In particular, we curate a dataset consisting of real-world images taken from ground stations and their corresponding weather data. We also propose MIS-ME - Meteorological & Image based Soil Moisture Estimator, a multi-modal framework for soil moisture estimation.

Second, PA pavements' fatigue life and durability are affected significantly by climate factors; the two most critical factors being aging conditions and moisture actions. Third, because of the environmental concerns connected with producing or repairing asphalt pavements using only virgin materials, studies have recommended reusing reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) materials. On the other hand, their use in road pavement is negative to the fatigue performance of asphalt pavements, especially PA. Therefore, modifying PA mixtures containing RAP to address the mentioned issues is necessary. Researchers have found that modifying asphalt mixes using nanotechnology is one of the more effective methods. The four-point bending beam fatigue test is one of the most dependable tests to assess the fatigue performance of asphalt mixtures, and evaluating the fatigue resistance of nano-modified PA mixes containing RAP under laboratory conditions by performing this test is essential. This study aims to investigate the fatigue behavior of different compounds of PA mixtures modified with nano zinc oxide (NZ) (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%) containing various contents of RAP materials (0%, 25%, and 50%) under normal, long-term aging, and freeze–thaw (F–T) cycle conditions. Moreover, the self-healing capability of these PA samples was evaluated using this test by performing two 24-h recovery periods following the first and second loading. It can be inferred from the result that although adding RAP and inducting long-term aging and moisture-damaged conditions negatively influenced PA mixes' fatigue lives, incorporating NZ caused increases in these values by averages of 114%. Besides, results indicated that applied rest periods were observed to significantly impact PA specimens' self-healing capability, resulting in longer fatigue life for them. On average, conventional and NZ-modified PA mixes with/without RAP could recover up to 32 and 48% of their fatigue resistance in all conditions.",2022-09-21,1.691,13,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4296468771,,FALSE,TRUE,green,https://repository.tudelft.nl/file/File_0978d131-8143-4532-846b-2d52c41e63bb,TRUE,https://openalex.org/S111427844,0899-1561,https://openalex.org/P4310315747,American Society of Civil Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)mt.1943-5533.0004488,NA,NA,NA,,58,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,NA,NA,34,12

First, due to the presence of acidic contaminants in surface runoffs in developed areas rooted in acid rainfall, researchers have discovered that these polluted runoffs can pollute groundwater reserves and are harmful to humans. Second, the porous asphalt (PA) mixtures as a hot mix pavement with an empty space structure have significant performance limitations such as low strength and durability because of their large amount of air voids. Therefore, a novel high-quality and photocatalyst PA pavement with the ability to absorb contaminants from acidic water was introduced at the lab scale in this study. For this aim, PA mixes modified with photocatalytic nanoparticles such as nano zinc oxide (ZnO) and nanosilica (SiO2) were fabricated. The sol-gel method was used to manufacture photocatalytic based on ZnO/SiO2 (ZS) in this research. The aforementioned compound reacts with UV light and oxidizes pollutant particles, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx). This novel PA mix was tested by environmental tests (pollutants absorption) and mechanical performance tests (dynamic creep, resilient modulus, moisture susceptibility, and fatigue life). The results demonstrated that adding the photocatalytic nano-ZS to the bitumen effectively removed acidic contaminants such as NO3 and SO4 from the water by an average of 48% in 24 hours. Besides, results showed that the addition of nano-ZS increased the moisture susceptibility and stiffness of PA mixtures by an average of 45% and caused a dramatic improvement in the rutting resistance of mixes. Moreover, nano-ZS-modified PA mixes had longer fatigue lives than conventional ones. It should be noted that the optimum amount of nano-ZS in PA mixes in this study was 7%.",2023-05-30,1.347,6,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4381572078,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,NA,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S111427844,0899-1561,https://openalex.org/P4310315747,American Society of Civil Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1061/jmcee7.mteng-14543,NA,NA,NA,,74,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,NA,NA,35,8

While previous research has indeed yielded findings about operator behavior, such studies were generally based on data derived from Aviation Safety Reporting System filings or the UAS sighting report database maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration. In this study, the authors partnered with a UAS technology company to deploy an AeroScope, a passive radiofrequency detection device, to detect UAS flight activity in an urban area. While the device was limited to collecting flight information from only DJImanufactured platforms, it is estimated that the company holds a market share in excess of 70% providing a reasonable barometer for sUAS activity in the sample area.

The lack of an established UAS benchmark for Detect, Sense and Avoid Systems put the preponderance of avoidance efforts on manned aircraft pilots to visually see and avoid potential collision threats. The small size, unusual configurations, and diverse operational applications of unmanned systems make UAS platforms difficult to visually identify. This paper sought to determine the mean visibility distance of small UAS systems (sUAS) to an alerted pilot flying a general aviation aircraft in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The study evaluated mean visibility distance to various small UAS platforms based on a scripted set of UAS convergence conditions. The study utilized a quantitative, experimental design in which a general aviation aircraft was flown into a UAS operations area. Study pilots were instructed to locate a flying UAS aircraft without bearing assistance. Both the UAS and manned aircraft were assigned vertically de-conflicted altitudes with the UAS aircraft executing a series of converging and crossing courses relative to the manned aircraft. The distance at which the pilot visually located the UAS platform was timestamped and electronically recorded via a GPS tracking device.

Public comments to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking indicated potential safety concerns regarding a pilot’s ability to spot a low-altitude sUAS during nighttime conditions. Leveraging data from the FAA’s UAS Sighting Report Database, the research team evaluated the significance of aircraft encounters with UAS at night. Researchers conducted an inflight experiment in which 10 pilots performed an instrument approach to airport during nighttime conditions in which a multi-rotor sUAS presented a potential collision hazard. The sUAS was equipped with lighting visible for 3 miles with a sufficient flash rate to avoid a collision, as specified by the new regulation. Participants performed five approaches, with the sUAS flying different scripted encounter profiles. Participants were asked to indicate when they visually spotted the sUAS, with sighting data recorded via an onboard observer. Geolocation information from both the aircraft and sUAS were compared at the time of each reported sighting to assess visibility distance and orientation. The sUAS was successfully spotted during 30 percent (n = 12) of the testing passes. Hovering sUAS were spotted at the same rate as moving sUAS, however, sUAS in motion were spotted at a much greater range. Researchers noted disproportionately higher spotting rates occurred when the sUAS was oriented on the starboard side of the aircraft vs. the port side. It is believed that airport lighting systems may have obscured or otherwise camouflaged portside sUAS encounters. When asked to estimate distance to an encountered sUAS, most participants underestimated, perceiving the sUAS to be much closer than reality. Additionally, the researchers assessed the potential for the participants to initiate evasive maneuvers, based on the distance and closure rate of the aircraft and sUAS at the time of sighting. Based on the FAA’s Aircraft Identification and Reaction Time Chart, collision avoidance would only have been successful during 15 percent of encounters (n = 6). The research team recommends Remote Pilots employ vigilant traffic awareness during nighttime operations, and leverage use of ADS-B (In) technology and monitor Common Traffic Advisory Frequencies to maintain situational awareness—particularly when operating in proximity to airports.",2021-01-01,0.397,3,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3136052567,,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1568&context=ijaaa,FALSE,https://openalex.org/S2764926913,2374-6793,https://openalex.org/P4310315880,Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University,https://doi.org/10.15394/ijaaa.2021.1568,https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1568&context=ijaaa,cc-by-nc-nd,publishedVersion,,7,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,en,,,NA,NA,NA,NA

Aiding this rapid expansion is the ability of this tick to reproduce parthenogenically and feed on diverse host species. In cattle, this tick can cause heavy burdens and act as a vector for the pathogenic hemoprotozoan parasite Theileria orientalis, genotype Ikeda, creating economic losses that impact the cattle industry. Here, we report Asian longhorned ticks, collected from cattle, a dog, and pastures and morphologically identified at the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory as H. longicornis before molecular confirmation through PCR amplification of the cox1 gene.

To identify canine Rhipicephalus spp. in Canada and determine the influence of travel history on infestation, ticks morphologically identified as brown dog ticks (n = 93) collected from dogs (n = 13) in British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec, Canada were submitted with information regarding each dog's geographic location and travel history. Nucleic acid was extracted from available individual ticks (n = 86) and PCR was used to amplify sequences of a 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene fragment. Sequences were compared to published reference sequences of known species and a phylogenetic tree constructed. Twenty-three ticks (26.7%) consistent with R. linnaei were identified on seven dogs, including dogs from British Columbia and Ontario, with a median infestation intensity of 2 ticks/dog (mean = 3.3 ticks/dog). Sixty-one ticks (70.9%) consistent with R. sanguineus s.s. were found on two dogs from Québec and Ontario (median = 30.5 ticks/dog; mean = 30.5 ticks/dog). One dog from Ontario was infested with R. rutilus (n = 2) (2.3%). Species could not be determined for ticks from three dogs from Ontario and Québec. Most infested dogs (10/13; 76.9%) had a recent (< 1 month) international travel history. These data confirm that multiple species of canine Rhipicephalus are occasionally found in Canada and suggest introduction following travel is likely responsible for these infestations.
